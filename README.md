A simple Android application implemented in Kotlin.  Displayes a list of random cat facts loaded from [this API](https://catfact.ninja/#!/Cat_Facts/fact)

## Functionality:

- Scrolling to the bottom of the list of facts triggers the load of 10 additional facts

- Changing the slider value will trigger the content to be reloaded with the new maximum fact length

- Tapping on a fact presents sharing options
